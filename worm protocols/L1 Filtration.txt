Supplies:
* Nylon Net Filters 11 µm (Millipore #NY1102500)
* 25mM Easy Pressure Syringe Filter Holder (Pall Life Sciences #4320)
* 3ml syringe
* Flat filter forceps
* Microfuge tube for collection

Note:  11 µm filters can allow L2s to pass. Sizes can be optimized for other ages, or for more L1 specificity: http://wormbook.org/wli/wbg4.1p16/

Steps:
1) Wash worms off plate using 1.5 - 2 mL of M9 or S-basal, etc.  If OP50 needs to be removed, spin worms to pellet, remove supernatant and rinse with ~1.5 mL of fresh buffer. Adding 0.01 - 0.1% Triton X-100 helps remove the worms and prevents adherence to pipette tips.

2) Unscrew the Easy Pressure Syringe Filter Holder and remove the stopper and plug on either side of the holder.

3) Remove brown gasket

4) Using forceps, remove blue separating paper and pick up an 11 micron filter and place it on the metal mesh surface of the syringe filter holder.

5) Place brown gasket on top of the filter paper, then screw on until just tight.

6) Get out a clean microfuge tube to collect the filtered L1 worms. 

7)A ttach the syringe to the syringe filter holder and put filter holder over your collection tube.

8) Take plunger out of the 3ml syringe and dump or pipet in suspended worms. Wiggle plunger down a bit and then gently press plunger completely down, collecting L1s in the clean empty microfuge tube.

9) To Clean:  Unscrew filter holder.  Remove filter paper and throw away. Close back up and run ethanol and then water through the filter holder 

10) Take filter holder apart and place on paper towel to dry, put away when dry.
