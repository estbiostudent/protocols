Freezing solution (autoclave):
S Buffer [129 ml 0.05 M K2HPO4, 871 ml 0.05 M KH2PO4, 5.85 g NaCl] + 30% glycerin (v/v)


1) Prepare at least 3 plates of each strain, and wait until the plates are freshly starved with lots of L1s these survive freeze/thaw best). It is important that the plates haven't starved more than overnight.

2) Put 800 µL M9 on each plate, and wash worms off into a 2 mL tube yield ~1.8 mL).

3) Spin down ~30 sec in mini-centrifuge to pellet L1s.

4) Aspirate to 900 µL or so.

5) Add 900 µL freezing solution, mixing well.

6) Mixing each time, transfer 500 µL solution to each of three cryo-vials. Retain remaining ~300 µL in 2 mL tube as tester.

7) Freeze at -80°C in slow-cooling Biocision foam container. Make sure that unused slots in container are populated with dummy glycerol-filled vials.

8) After ~5 days at -80°C, thaw test vial and make sure an adequate yield of L1s is recovered.

9) If thaw was successful, transfer 1 vial to liquid N2, 1 vial to -80°C replicate backup, and keep 1 vial for personal use.
