Crossbreeding Worms
===================

1) Make sure there is an adequate supply of mating plates (6 cm NGM plates with small 100 ÂµL drop of OP50 food in center).

2) Transfer ~15 males to the plate. Pick L3-L4 males, ideally. Pre-adult males can be identified because the mating ray is not yet fully "deployed". Instead of looking like a barb (as on adults), it's a smoother bulge on one side of the tail.

3) Transfer 3 L3 hermaphrodites to the plate. L3s are identifiable by the wide "crescent moon" pattern of the developing vulva,

4) Wait until offspring are approximately L2 or L3, and then remove the adult males from the plate (to avoid confusion with their offspring). 

5) A day later, remove the gravid hermaphrodites from the plate. Now the plate contains only self- and cross-progeny. Identify cross progeny either by taking males only, or by some other phenotypic means. This may require letting the plate grow up another day, which is why we remove the hermaphrodites.
