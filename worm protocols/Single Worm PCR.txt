10× Lysis Buffer:
    0.5 M KCl
    100 mM Tris (pH 8.3)
    25 mM MgCl2
    4.5% Nonidet P-40
    4.5% Tween-20
    0.1% w/v Gelatin
* Note: any 10× Taq buffer or other PCR buffer generally works fine, but this is the official recipe.

1)  Thaw on ice:
	- 10× Lysis Buffer
    - 10 mg/mL Proteinase K
	- Taq Master Mix
    - nuclease-free water
    - primers necessary primers

2) Prepare 1× Lysis Buffer (5-10 µL required per worm)
	For 100 µL:
	    1 µL Proteinase K (100 µg/mL final concentration)
	    10 µL 10× buffer
	    89 µL water

3) Prepare Tubes for Worm Lysis:
	- Aliquot 5 µL of Lysis Buffer into each PCR tube
	- Carefully pick individual worms into each tube
	- Flick tubes and briefly spin with benchtop centrifuge

4) Worm lysis cycle on PCR machine:
    60°C for 60 min
    95°C for 15 min to inactivate proteinase K
    4°C cool

5) Prepare a “Master Master-Mix” using the Taq Master Mix and other PCR components:
	-Final volume 25 µL, including 5µL of worm lysis 
	-Remaining components:
        12.5 uL of the 2X Taq Master Mix
        0.75 uL of each primer
        water to bring volume to 25 µL.
	-Prepare such that you have enough for ~3 extra reactions

6) Add 20 µL of above master mix to each of the tubes and PCR cycle.
