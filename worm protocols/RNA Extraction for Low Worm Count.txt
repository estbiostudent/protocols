0) Spray down workspace with RNase Zapper

1) Pipette worms from plates into 1.7 mL eppendorf tube, discard supernatant to ~100 µL

2) Add 400 µL Trizol in hood, making total volume ~500 µL.

3) Snap freeze tubes in liquid nitrogen, thaw on 37°C hot block.

4) Repeat step 3 two more times for three freeze-thaw cycles in total.

5) Add 200µL more Trizol in hood.

6) Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.

7) Add 140 µL chloroform in hood, vortex 60 sec, incubate at room temperature for 3 minutes.

8) Spin tubes at max speed at 4°C for 15 min.

9) Carefully transfer top aqueous phase to new 1.7 mL tube - avoid transferring all to reduce phenol contamination.

10) Transfer aqueous layer to a new tube, add 1/10 volume 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2 µL Glycoblue. Next add 2-3 volumes of 100% ethanol.

11) Place tubes at -20°C overnight.

12) Spin tubes at max speed at 4°C for 10 min.

13) After spin should see soft blue precipitate. Completely discard supernatant.

14) Add 1 mL of 70% ethanol, invert 1-3 times.

15) Spin tubes at max speed at 4°C for 10 minutes.

16) Discard supernatant without disturbing pellet, air-dry for about 10 min. (Smell test: if you still smell ethanol, wait longer, if not, immediately move to next step.)

17) Resuspend pellet in 30 µL of RNase-free water preheated to 68°C.

18) Add 3 µL 10X Turbo DNase Buffer and 1µL Turbo DNase to RNA solution, mix gently.

19) Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.

20) Add 3 µL resuspended DNase Inactivation reagent, mix well.

21) Incubate for 5 min at room temperature, flicking tube 2-3 times during incubation.

22) Spin tubes at 10,000g for 1.5 min and decant RNA into fresh tube.

23) Add RNase-free water (pre-heated to 68°C) to a total volume of 200 µL.

24) Add 20 µL sodium acetate (from on ice), 200 µL phenol-chloroform (in hood), vortex 30-60 sec.

25) Incubate at room temp for 5 min, centrifuge at 12000g for 5 min.

26) Transfer aqueous layer to fresh tubes add equal volume of chloroform.

27) Vortex, incubate at room temp for 5 min.

28) Centrifuge at 12000g for 5 min, transfer aqueous layer to fresh tube.

29) Add 2-3 volumes of 100% ethanol, 2µL glycoblue and incubate at -20°C for 1 hour.

30) Centrifuge 10000g for 10 min at 4C°.

31) Repeat steps 13-17.
